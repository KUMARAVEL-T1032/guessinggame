# guessinggame
The provided Streamlit application features two interactive number-guessing games. In the **"User Guessing Game"**, the user specifies a range of numbers, and the app generates a random number within that range. The user then attempts to guess the number with feedback provided after each attempt, such as "Too low" or "Too high." The game tracks the number of attempts until the user guesses correctly. In the **"Machine Guessing Game"**, the user thinks of a number within a specified range, and the app attempts to guess it using binary search logic. The user provides feedback—whether the machine's guess is "Too Low," "Too High," or "Correct"—until the machine identifies the correct number. Both games emphasize interactivity and provide a fun way to explore guessing algorithms.
